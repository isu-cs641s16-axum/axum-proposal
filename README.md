4. Why is the targeted problem interesting for a programming language theory audience?

5. What is the proposed solution?

6. Examples to illustrate the proposed solution.

8. What are some other related work (8-12)?

9. What are 3-5 ways to evaluate that you are successful? (Beyond proving type soundness, and without implementation work. Hint: look over evaluation in top conference papers e.g. POPL, ECOOP)

## Instructions for Com S 641 Midterm Project Presentation 1

0. Your presentation must be between 35-40 minutes.

1. You MUST attribute your sources. For example, if you use a picture or a slide from another presentation on that topic then that slide containing material from other source should contain a footnote stating where it came from. A presentation that does not properly attribute its sources is in violation of this class's policy on academic honesty.

2. Add and remove LaTeX files as you see fit, but the main file should be `presentation.tex`. The structure of your presentation can be different from the template.

3. DO NOT change the presentation template or theme. We would like each presentation theme to look identical throughout the class.

4. Rename the directory to `<teamname>-proposal`.

5. Make sure that the presentation compiles without errors using the Makefile.

6. Zip the entire presentation directory as `<teamname>proposal.zip` and upload it here on blackboard.
